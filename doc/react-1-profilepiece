This details the design of the profile piece, a react component that can be dynamically changed.

A profile piece's state is composed of:
{
	PieceId: <Int>
	PieceType: <String>
	PieceData: { Dict of data for the piece } // i.e. the text for a bio, the number of listens to display.
}

A profile is always composed of atleast 2 profile pieces that are blank and can be added to. These are 
only displayed when the profile belongs to the user. Otherwise they are not displayed.

A profile piece is typically composed of:
 - A profile piece object
 - a settings modal
 - a settings button

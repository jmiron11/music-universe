Expand the site to support fluidly sharing music between friends.

Existing music recommendation methods:
   - Share over social media / messaging

Suppose I want to recomend or talk about a song with a friend:
   1. Who has listened to this track before? (Listen tracking)
   2. Who hasn't listened to this track but might love the song? (Music profile)
   3. Have I recommended this music to the person before? (Sharing history)

1. Support recommending music to a user / a group
   
2. Each user has an interactive recommendation feed: A place that tracks all of the received recommendations.

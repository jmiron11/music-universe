Impl -----
React component:  Use Chart.js
	Dynamic timeline chart. Plots the time that events happen, each event represented by a dot

	By default: All tracks
	Button in top-left for Search for...
	Button in the top-right for different aggregation times.

	Y-axis number of listens
	X-axis time

	First-cut: Times that a track is listened to, with varying aggregation periods.

React component: 
	Dynamic aggregation chart. Plots the number of times an event occurs at each aggregation time.

	Ex. For each <hour, day, month, year>, how many (Both normalized and not) listens do I have.

For time periods: Total listening time, Average listens per day, Number of listens.


React component: Geo chart of listen locations

Last.fm has totally stagnated. I always thought they really never dug into what made them cool: the stats. I want to see more: what decade my music is from, what I'm most likely to listen to at 3pm, geographic visualization etc. Some people made plugins that made pretty visualizations, but they were hard to find.

Music visualizations over time, how have my music tastes changed?

I also like the ability to "love" tracks. Sometimes when listening to a lot of music, or new stuff, I have trouble remembering which tracks really stood out. Sometimes I think, "What was that one with the bitchin' guitar riff? Was it track 4? 5? 6?" and it is just really to click the heart and it is saved for me.
	- Ability to love tracks with a note.


As far as the social aspect, I'm not really interested at all. I guess it would be kind of cool to see what my friends are listening to, and vice versa, but my friends that are into music and I often discuss that kind of stuff face-to-face anyway so I'm not sure I want something that actually substitutes or even detracts from real human interaction (that's the last thing I need, I'm already too much of a hermit). Most people seem to think I'm a bit crazy for caring that much about the data of my listening habits.
	- This is a good point, don't want to detract from real human interaction. Want to encourage conversation.
	- Post type: Ask for thoughts on music.

Yup, just want that glorious, beautiful, searchable, filterable data. ... that I was curious about their most-played and least-played tracks.
	- Artist data: most played, least played tracks, albums, etc.

It's a shame that last.fm hasn't really capitalized on the data aspect of the service and tried to make it more social.
